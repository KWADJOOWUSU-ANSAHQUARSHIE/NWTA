Hospital Management

Ideally, hospitals use a manual format for collecting information and data as valid feedback for the organization and better treatment of patients who go for treatment, check-ups, and other activities. 

So, we made an application that will help the Doctor, Patient, and Staff to input all the necessary details from any candidate who attends the hospital.

The system is aimed to reduce the cost of health care by eliminating the use of folders.
